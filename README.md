# React-Native---Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol
This is a React Native demo App for Twilio Programmable Voice SDK that lets you make and receive calls from your ReactNatvie App. 

A Voice over IP call, or VoIP call, utilizes packet-switched Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or Internet telephony as opposed to the circuit-switched telephony used by the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The advantage to VoIP phone calls is that unlike regular long-distance calls, calls made through a VoIP phone service are free â€“ there are no fees beyond the cost of your Internet access.
